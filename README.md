# Adventure Snack Redesign

## Summary

Geoffrey Golden is a narrative writer for gaming and entertainment companies. Since 2019, he's been publishing [Adventure Snack](https://www.adventuresnack.com/), a “Choose Your Own Adventure” fiction magazine. While the story introduction pages had a fairly good design, the branching narrative pages’ layout and typography were too small, and were illegible on mobile. I redesigned those pages to better use available space and to read comfortably on multiple screen sizes.
