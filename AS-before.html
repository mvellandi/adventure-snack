        “Hold on everyone,” you tell the crew in the Helm Room. “I have an idea.
        A very brave idea…”
      </p>

      <p>
        You valiantly leave the room, then sneakily tip-top over to the Escape
        Pod Room. The room is locked, but after inserting your Captain’s Club
        card into the reader, the metal door whooshes up. This is your chance to
        escape while the escaping’s good!
      </p>

      <p>
        You take a seat in the escape pod. It’s cozy. The chair is soft and
        velvety and there’s a viewscreen playing Flee TV. There’s a netted
        pocket beneath the viewscreen. You look inside to find a box of
        Andromedamine, a pill designed to combat space travel sickness.
