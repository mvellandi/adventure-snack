          “Hold on everyone,” you tell the crew in the Helm Room. “I have an
          idea. A very brave idea…”
        </p>

        <p>
          You valiantly leave the room, then sneakily tip-top over to the Escape
          Pod Room. The room is locked, but after inserting your Captain’s Club
          card into the reader, the metal door whooshes up. This is your chance
          to escape while the escaping’s good!
        </p>

        <p>
          You take a seat in the escape pod. It’s cozy. The chair is soft and
          velvety and there’s a viewscreen playing Flee TV. There’s a netted
          pocket beneath the viewscreen. You look inside to find a box of
          Andromedamine, a pill designed to combat space travel sickness.
